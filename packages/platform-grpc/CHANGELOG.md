# Change Log

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a4a01af: Fixed the published peer dependencies of each package

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- e82c80b: NestJS v9 Support

  ## Features

  - Use the new `ConfigurableModuleBuilder` from `@nestjs/common@9`
  - Support Fastify v4
    - As a side effect, `@ogma/platform-graphql-fastify` can **only** be used with `@nestjs/mercurius` until `apollo-server-fastify` supports v4

  ## How to Upgrade

  Run your preferred pacakge manager's method of ugrading. There's no code chagnes necessary to the ogma imports, but implications of underlying packages that should be taken into consideration

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 329f92a: Set the main file in the package.json correctly based on the proper publish method

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5e51fdc: Update package versions to work with Nest v8

  # Breaking Changes

  For `@ogma/nestjs-module` and all of the `@ogma/platform-*` packages, Nest v8 is the supported package version. Nest v7 may still continue to work, but has no guarantees. Also, RxJS is upgraded to v7 to stay inline with Nest's expectations.

  # Why the change was made

  To stay current with Nest.

  # How to upgrade

  Upgrade with Nest v8. There shouldn't be any breaking underlying changes, but you can never be too careful with coded upgrades.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8bea02f: Release of `@ogma/common` and `@ogma/styler`. Upgrade `@ogma/nestjs-module` to be 100% compatible with Nest's logger

  # Breaking Changes

  - `@ogma/logger` now depends on `@ogma/common` and `@ogma/styler` for types and string styling, instead of managing it on its own
  - `@ogma/nestjs-module` now accepts `trace` as the second parameter to `error` instead of `context`. `meta` can still be passed as a second parameter too or it can be a third parameter.
  - `@ogma/logger` now sets an `ool` property when logging in JSON mode to accommodate when using a custom log map
  - `@ogma/logger` no longer needs the `stream` property to have a `hasColor` function
  - `@ogma/cli` now reads from the `ool` property instead `level` to allow writing back to Ogma's standard format

  # Features

  - `@ogma/logger` now correctly logs Error objects the same way `process.stdout` does instead of logging `{}`
  - `@ogma/logger` can accept a `levelMap` property for custom level mapping
  - `@ogma/logger`'s `stream` option can now have a `getColorDepth` property method, but it is not necessary

  # Why

  I wanted to be able to have full control over string styles and this gave me a great chance to learn about SGRs and how they work. Along with that, this gave me the perfect opportunity to make some changes to the logger to be more compliant with Nest's logger and have better compatibility with it.

  # How to Upgrade

  I tried to make this is painless as possible in terms of breaking changes. For the most part, you should just be able to upgrade with no problems. If you have a stream with `hasColor` you will need to remove that method. You may want to add in the `getColorDepth` method, but can also just use `FORCE_COLOR` if necessary.

### Major Changes

- bbf66f6: Major release of @ogma

  The `ogma` command has been moved from `@ogma/logger` to `@ogma/cli`. There are no other breaking changes. This change was made to keep the package size as small as possible and to keep the code clean and maintainable.
