# @Ogma

Ogma is a no-nonsense logger developed to make logging simple, and easy to read in development, while also having a powerful JSON form when it comes to production level logs, to make it easier to parse and consume by external services. This monorepo has all of the code for the base logger, the binary to rehydrate the JSON logs, and the [NestJS Module](https://nestjs.com) along with supported plugins for the module's interceptor.
